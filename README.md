# Web App – Telephone Shop

This project was developed as part of the university course **"Scripting Languages"**.  
The assignment was to design and implement a simple **web shop application**.  
The chosen theme was a **telephone shop**, adapted for the Serbian market, so product names and labels are written in Serbian.  

The application includes two main roles:  
- **Admin side** – where administrators can manage products and user information.  
- **User side** – where customers can browse, select, and order flowers.

## Architecture  

- **Authentication service** – handles user and admin login and registration.  
- **Backend service** – communicates with the database and processes requests.  
- **Frontend service** – provides the interface for both customers and administrators.
